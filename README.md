ParticleFountain
================

An OpnGL program modelling particles in 3D space,

This a work in progress class assignment. At 1.0 it should include a particle fountain, rain system, particle fountain, and some basic collision detection. The project itself doesn't really fill any need, but it may be useful to those looking to learn about how a glut OpenGL program operates. Currently this is tested on a Mac and a Linux machine, but it should compile on Windows. I don't believe I've used any exclusive libraries.

Later features might include extra collision objects, particle follow camera, lighting, wind, and exploding particles.
