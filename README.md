ParticleFountain
================

An OpnGL program modelling particles in 3D space,

A particle fountain with a variety of systems: rain, cannon, fountain. Bounciness of particles can be changed while running. The project itself doesn't really fill any need, but it may be useful to those looking to learn about how a glut OpenGL program operates. Currently this is tested on a Mac and a Linux machine, but it should compile on Windows.
